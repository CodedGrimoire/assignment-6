1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
    Ans: In JavaScript language,the difference between var, let, and const is that var is function-scoped and allows redeclaration, on the other hand, let and const are both block-scoped and do not allow redeclaration within the same block. Variables declared with let can be reassigned, but const creates a constant reference that cannot be reassigned.


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
    Ans:map() is an array method that  transforms each element and returns a new array of the same length and on the other hand,filter() is also an array method that returns a new array containing only elements that pass a given condition.forEach() executes a function for each element but returns undefined. 


3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
    Ans:Arrow functions are a shorter syntax in ES6 that are used to write functions using () => {} instead using for..of loop or map.This reduces the number of the lines of the code,reduces complexity and they are useful in object methods. 


4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
    Ans:Destructuring assignment is the process of extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into variables. Objects are often given in a particular structures,destructuring means converting them into usable or distinct variables.


5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
    Ans:Template literals and string concatenation in ES6 differ in a way that template literals use backticks (`) instead of quotes and support string interpolation with ${expression} whereas string concatenation does it with +.
